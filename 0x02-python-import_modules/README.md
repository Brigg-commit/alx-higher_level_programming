# This is 0x02. Python - import & modules project
# Definitions

Python code in one module gains access to the code in another module by the process of importing it. The import statement is the most common way of invoking the import machinery.The import statement combines two operations; it searches for the named module, then it binds the results of that search to a name in the local scope.

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. Within a module, the moduleâ€™s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__.
